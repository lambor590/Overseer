# Overseer Bot

A Discord bot that I made for my server to do random things.
Strings are in Spanish because I'm from Spain, but you can change them to English if you want.

2. Clone this repository.
3. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values.
4. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
5. Run `npm start` to start the bot.
